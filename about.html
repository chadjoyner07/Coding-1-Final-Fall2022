                <br>
                <p>My name is Chad Joyner and I was born March 12th, 2007. My dad has always loved computers and he would code in his free-time.
                    I remeber sitting in his mancave and playing on my Nintendo 3dXL and ocasionally seeing him either playing video games or coding on his computer. Eventually when I started to get into technology and build my own pc, I got really interested in coding and all the programming stuff that goes into a single website. All the possible ways and colors and layouts you can have for one page blows my mind. Although I suck at being creative the thought of making something out of nothing makes me feel proud of myself.
